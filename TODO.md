# UI
* INTERVAL / NOTE SWITCH IN FOR THE CHORD DEF VIEW
- Note Selector
- Scale / Chord Switch
- Free form mode (turn intervals on to create custom chords) (?)
- Save & Share Options
- Sound


# ISSUES:
- changes in url should not completely refresh page - should be a one page app.
- adding strings re-renders all strings
 

# Definition View
- Note Name / Interval Name  - switch
- Sound (?)

# Note Dictionary
- Smart Vs Hard Coded ??? - MAYBE NOT

# Design

- design UI elements
- consider bootstrap for autocomplete modal and popover components
- create interval font(?)
