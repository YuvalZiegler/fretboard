# UI

##  INTERVAL / NOTE SWITCH
### Will set application state to display note names (A-G) or interval names (1/R, m3, M3, etc.)

    Find the proper place for the switch state
    is it a part of the Definition view?
    should it be in a more generic module such as the router
    or a specialized module for app state maybe as a constant?

- Note Selector
- Scale / Chord Switch
- Free form mode (turn intervals on to create custom chords) (?)
- Save & Share Options
- Sound


# ISSUES:
- changes in url should not completely refresh page - should be a one page app.
- adding strings re-renders all strings
 

# Definition View
- Note Name / Interval Name  - switch
- Sound (?)

# Note Dictionary
- Smart Vs Hard Coded ??? - MAYBE NOT - Maybe V2

# Design
- design UI elements
- consider bootstrap for autocomplete, modal and popover components
- create interval font(?)
